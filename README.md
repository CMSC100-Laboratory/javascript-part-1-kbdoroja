this program emulates a password validation program mainly checking for three conditions: passwords matches, given format is followed, and there are atleast 8 characters
validatePassword() handles the checking of the conditions, 
reverse() reverses the string
storePassword() returns an object given validatePassword returns true, 
  if validatePassword is true, returns the user's name as well as the reversed string for the new password
  if false, returns user's name as but with an unreversed first password given
